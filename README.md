## About me:

Hi! My name Maria-Theresa and I am 16 years old. I'm a 10th grade student at the Elisabeth von Thadden School. I have always been fascinated by MINT: Mathematics, Informatics, Natural Science, and Technology subjects ([more info](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINT-F%C3%A4cher)), therefore I started to do small MINT projects very early on. Now, as I have gained more understanding of these topics, I am more and more interested in Informatics, especially in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). I am also very interested in medicine and biology. 

In my free time, I play sports. I have been playing tennis since I was 7 years old, but since 2015 I am focussing more on golf, which I get to play at the competitive level. 

I also love to play piano, which I have been learning for more then 9 years.

### EMBL Teen Project

I am a part of EMBL Teens club at the [European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL)](https://www.embl.de/), Heidelberg. *EMBL is Europe’s flagship laboratory for the life sciences.*

> "EMBL Teens is a club for the high school students interested in life sciences, where they get the chance to look at scientific research from a different angle, just in exchange for their passion and their interest!"

From July to September, the 'Friends of EMBL' department is running a project with EMBL female researchers and girls from the EMBL Teens club. A few girls from EMBL teen, including me, has been paired with a women researcher at EMBL where we will take mentorship roles of mentees and mentors. The EMBL researchers will introduce us to their research work, their life as a scientist and a few important skills that have been useful for them. 

As part of this project, I will attend the European Researchers’ Night taking place at EMBL on 27 September 2019. An exhibition will be organised to show our work together in the form of visual display, video or presentation.

This page will summarise my work as an EMBL teen, my interests in computational biology, data analysis, and artificial intelligence, and Malvika Sharan - a computational biologist and community outreach coordinator at EMBL, who shares my interests and will share a few days of her work with me at EMBL.
