## About me:

My name Maria-Theresa and I am 16 years old. I'm going in the 10th grade at the Elisabeth von Thadden School. I was always fascinated by MINT, so I started to do little MINT projects very early. Now as I am getting older I am more and more interested in Informatics, especially in AI and machine learning. But I also like medicine and biology. In my free time I played since I was 7 years old tennis but now I am focussing more on golf, which I play now since 2015. I also play piano for more or less 9 years.

### EMBL Teen Project

*From August to September, the 'Friends of EMBL' department is running a small project with EMBL female researchers and girls from the EMBL Teens, an EMBL club for high school students interested in life sciences. Each girl has been paired with a women researcher at EMBL where they will take a mentorship roles as a mentee and mentor. The EMBL researcher will introduce their mentees to their research work, their life as a scientist and a few important skills that have been useful for them. As part of the European Researchersâ€™ Night that will take place at EMBL on 27 September 2019, an exhibition will be organised to show their work in the form of visual display, video or presentation.*

This page will summarise the work of Maria-Theresa - an EMBL teen, who is learning about computational biology, data analysis, and artificial intelligence in her spare time, and Malvika Sharan - a computational biologist and community outreach coordinator at EMBL, who shares the interests of Maria-Theresa.
