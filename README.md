## About me:

My name Maria-Theresa and I am 16 years old. I'm going in the 10th grade at the Elisabeth von Thadden School. I was always fascinated by MINT (Mathematics, Informatics, Natural Science, and Technology) ([more info](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINT-F%C3%A4cher), so I started to do little MINT projects very early. Now as I am getting older I am more and more interested in Informatics, especially in AI and machine learning. But I also like medicine and biology. In my free time I played since I was 7 years old tennis but now I am focussing more on golf, which I play now since 2015. I also play piano for more or less 9 years.

### EMBL Teen Project

*From July to September, the 'Friends of EMBL' department is running a project with EMBL female researchers and girls from the EMBL Teens club of high school students interested in life sciences. Each girl has been paired with a women researcher at EMBL where they will take mentorship roles of mentees and mentors. The EMBL researchers will introduce their mentees to their research work, their life as a scientist and a few important skills that are useful for them. As part of the European Researchers’ Night taking place at EMBL on 27 September 2019, an exhibition will be organised to show their work in the form of visual display, video or presentation.*

This page will summarise the work of Maria-Theresa - an EMBL teen, who is learning about computational biology, data analysis, and artificial intelligence in her spare time, and Malvika Sharan - a computational biologist and community outreach coordinator at EMBL, who shares the interests of Maria-Theresa.
